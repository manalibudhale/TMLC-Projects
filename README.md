Project: Road Traffic Severity Classification

In this project, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to better understand the dataset. The data was visualized to identify patterns and detect any missing values, which were addressed during preprocessing. LabelEncoder was applied to convert categorical variables into a numeric form. The dataset was then split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

Multiple classification algorithms were trained, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost. Among these, the XGBoost classifier achieved the highest F1 score. Finally, hyperparameter tuning was performed to further enhance the XGBoost modelâ€™s performance.
